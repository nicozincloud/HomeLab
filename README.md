## üè†HomeLab

This repo contains all of the configuration and documentation of my homelab.

The sole purpose of my homelab is to learn and to have fun while self-hosting my homelab applications. Planning, deploying, setting up and maintaining some applications from A to Z is what I'll be focusing on in this self-hosted project.

## Planning

* Make sure to set a production and staging nodes for my application handling nodes
